## Abstract

The paper explores the role of Global Privacy Control (GPC) in the context of online user privacy and data tracking, examining its effectiveness under different privacy regulations like the CCPA in California and the GDPR in the European Union. The study analyzes HTTP requests and cookie data from websites to assess how GPC signals influence web tracking practices across different jurisdictions.
